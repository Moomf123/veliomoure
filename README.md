## ðŸ’¡ About Me

An aspiring accountant developer and a high school student, the name's Fleonie Veliomoure *pronounced as vel â€¢ oh â€¢ mow â€¢ ri*.  

## ðŸ’¼ Academic Pursuits

Currently in high school, I'm driven by the goal of becoming an accountant developer. The reason behind that is because I enjoy coding and I find myself intruiged in financial statistics. 

## ðŸš€ Language

Proficient in HTML and JavaScript, I am currently learning computer science and programming using Python! These languages not only serve as tools for crafting digital experiences but also as a foundation for my future endeavors.

## ðŸ“š Beyond the Code

When I'm not on my computer, immersed in bits and bytes, you can find me delving into surreal horror novels that send shivers down my spine. Surreal horror is a genre that can trully change our persepective about life. Gaming is another passion, and I particularly enjoy stragety card games like Legends of Runeterra.

## ðŸ“¬ Contact

I'm always open to connecting with fellow enthusiasts, whether it's to discuss the latest programming trends or exchanging recommendations for chilling novels. Feel free to reach out to me at f.veliomoure@outlook.com.
